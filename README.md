<hr>

### Here I have created a basic "Quiz Project" where we have to,
- Determine the answers for the Baby names of animals.
- So this is kind of like an interactive quiz that i have created, the question and answers on my own.
- But you can modify this to suit you.
- So, for example, you don't have to do a quiz based on the baby names of animals.
- You could do yours based on something completely different from mine.
- But obviously the format will be the same.
